# Code sample

Code for character movement used in **_Disco Samurai_**. Included code sample shows only main class implementation without dependencies.

Character movement in this context means kinematic rigidbody based movement for top-down character. This class is responsible only for physics side of movement - it allows to move character and to simulate movement (for example to predict character dash destination), but it doesn't provide implementation for audio-visual elements such as animations.
